# Description

<p>I was building an IoT device supposed to print you a flag, it was finished when I decided to take my lunch break.</p>
<p>When I came back the device the device wasn't printing flag anymore as you can see on the picture (<a id="object-link" class="link awsui-util-pb-m ng-binding" href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/be.cscbe.challenges.2019/StolenFolder_ab88659fcccaa2341c6b86f30d5ec15b/hacked.jpg">hacked.jpg</a>).</p>
<p>My colleague told me that this is what happens when you don't change your credentials.</p>
<p>Can you help me recover the flag my device was supposed to print ?</p>
