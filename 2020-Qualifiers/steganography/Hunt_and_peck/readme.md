# Hunt and peck

## Description
You were doing your usual round tonight, and you saw a bird pecking at keys on a keyboard.
Fortunately, Notepad was open, so you can read what was typed.
Did the bird write a message, or did it mistake the keyboard for a delicious meal?

## Solution
Letters' shapes are drawn on the keyboard using a finger.
Each letter is separated by a newline.
Drawings were done on a QWERTY keyboard.

Either use a paint program with an image of a keyboard, or trace out letters on paper with a pen over a qwerty keyboard to recover the encoded letters
