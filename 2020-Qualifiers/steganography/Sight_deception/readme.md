# Sight deception

## Description
I found this blind guy script! Though I am not good enough to understand what it is doing. 

Could you once again help me out?

## Solution
The provided python program is actually... a whitespace program!

This challenge is actually exactly the same as the previous whitespace challenge, except that the whitespace program is filled with letters, which do not change the outcome.

Once again, the contender will have to remove the lines 29 to 32 to solve the challenge.
