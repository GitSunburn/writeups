# Solution

*Whirl*'s first letter is uppercased, to tip off users as to what to search for

Searching for "Whirl Language" or "Whirl Code" should lead users to either [the Esolang wiki](https://esolang.org/wiki/Whirl) or [the Language's website](https://bigzaphod.github.io/Whirl/)

It's only a matter of running it in an interpreter such as [TryItOnline's](https://tio.run/#whirl) to get the flag.

If run with the -no-random-noop command, it can also be used as a decoding challenge (Every letter is just 4 zeroes in the parts with long strings of zeroes)
